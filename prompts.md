## Prompt 1
Create a webpage with a header containing a title and a navigation bar with three links.

## Prompt 2
Create a landing page for a pop-up restaurant called 'Pasta la Vista'â€”an Italian pop-up that disappears just as quickly as its dishes. 

The page should include a header with the restaurant name and navigation, a hero section with a large featured image (img/featured.png) and the tagline, a menu section with three featured dishes, and a contact section with a reservation button. 

Use clean, modern HTML and CSS with a warm, inviting color scheme and Google fonts that match an authentic Italian dining experience.
